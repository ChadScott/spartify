== Consistency ==
Current memcached based solution is suboptimal, and predictably the more people
participating, the more likely votes or tracks will get lost. In reality, this
doesn't pose itself as a major issue given the likely low number of participants
per party.

== Security ==
Potential issues with access levels, party guests may potentially be considered
hosts. Currently it's the frontend responsability to make sure this doesn't
happen, in the future the Backend should.
